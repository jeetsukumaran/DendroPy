<div class="toctree-wrapper compound">
</div>
<p>DendroPy is a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> library for phylogenetic computing.
It provides classes and functions for the simulation, processing, and manipulation of phylogenetic trees and character matrices, and supports the reading and writing of phylogenetic data in a range of formats, such as NEXUS, NEWICK, NeXML, Phylip, FASTA, etc.
Application scripts for performing some useful phylogenetic operations, such as data conversion and tree posterior distribution summarization, are also distributed and installed as part of the libary.
DendroPy can thus function as a stand-alone library for phylogenetics, a component of more complex multi-library phyloinformatic pipelines, or as a scripting “glue” that assembles and drives such pipelines.</p>
<section id="prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>DendroPy is a pure-Python library with no dependencies, and runs under any version of Python 3 and Python 2.7. If you want to run DendroPy under Python version of less than 2.7, you should download the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy/releases/tag/v3.12.1">DendroPy legacy release</a>.</p>
<div class="versionchanged">
<p><span class="versionmodified changed">Changed in version 4.0.0: </span>Python 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 support removed.
Python 3.x support added.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="installing">
<h2>Installing<a class="headerlink" href="#installing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can install directly from the main GitHub repository using:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy.git
$ python3 -m pip install git+git://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy.git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to install from a particular branch, e.g., the latest development branch, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">development-main</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy.git@development-main
$ python3 -m pip install git+git://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy.git@development-main
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>DendroPy is also fully easy-installable and can be installed using <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python3 -m pip install -U dendropy
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you do not have <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a> installed, you should <em>definitely</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html">install it</a> !
Other ways of obtaining and installing DendroPy (e.g., by downloading the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/D/DendroPy/DendroPy-5.0.2.tar.gz">DendroPy source code archive</a>, or by cloning the <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy">DendroPy Git repository</a>), are discussed in detail in the “<a class="reference internal" href="downloading.html"><span class="doc">Downloading and Installing DendroPy</span></a>” section.</p>
<p>If you are using the <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.io/docs/">conda package manager</a>, DendroPy can be installed to your conda environment via pip. From within an Anaconda terminal, or a <a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ import pip
$ pip.main([&#39;install&#39;, &#39;dendropy&#39;])
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>DendroPy will now be available in your conda-managed environment.</p>
<p>More information on downloading and installing DendroPy can be found in our <a class="reference internal" href="downloading.html"><span class="doc">setup instructions</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Feature Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-requests" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We are constantly expanding and improving the DendroPy library.
And we are constantly looking for ideas on <em>how</em> to expand and improve DendroPy.
If you have an idea that you would like to see implemented in DendroPy, or a need/requirement for some sort of functionality that DendroPy does not provide or does not provide easily, or, for that matter, a suggestion/idea for how something DendroPy already does that can be done better, <em>please</em> let us know by posting it as an issue on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy/issues">DendroPy Issues</a> page.
We take these very seriously, and look forward to ideas/suggestions/requests/critiques such as these, not only because they improve the library for the entire community of users, but also because they sometimes provide for interesting side-projects for us.</p>
</section>
<section id="bug-reports-and-other-issues">
<h2>Bug Reports and Other Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-reports-and-other-issues" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Everyone has issues.
And sometimes, not pointing them out is enabling rather than helping. So, if you encounter or think you have encountered a problem in the way DendroPy works, please report it on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy/issues">DendroPy Issues</a> page.
The DendroPy library has a really large suite of tests, but it is also a really, really, really, <em>really</em> large and complex library, and there are many nooks and crannies in which can scurry many crooks and nannies, so you will be doing us <em>and</em> the community a really generous favor by reporting bugs and problems.
Even if you are not sure if you are actually dealing with a bug, please do not hesitate to report it as an issue: false positives are better than false negatives in this context.</p>
<p>Having said that, <em>please</em> do take the trouble to write-up a decent bug report.
It really is quite frustrating to receive vague and lackadaisical “reports” that are little more than stream-of-consciousness responses to stimuli from the monitor that were almost accidentally blurted into the keyboard (e.g., “doesn’t work”).
At the very least, you should provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>A brief explication of what occurred, describing the operation that you were trying to do, and the result (or non-result) that you observed that led you to think there is an error.</p></li>
<li><p>The environment in which this error occurred. This includes, at the very least, the operating system, as well as things such as the python version, DendroPy version, the installation locations of DendroPy and the Python libraries, etc. Apart from the operating system, you can retrieve all this information by running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python -m dendropy
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The version of SumTrees that ships with DendroPy 4 onwards includes a special flag, “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--describe</span></code>” (i.e., you would type “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sumtrees.py</span> <span class="pre">--describe</span></code>”), that also provides this information.
Including the details of either of these commands in their entirety along with the operating system is not only useful, but essential.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have gone to great lengths to write sensible and meaningful error messages, and that chunk of text that usually appears on the screen on error (i.e., the “stack trace”) is packed with useful information, and should be included in its entirety should it appear.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to be able to reproduce the error on our side to be able to fix. Thus, providing a <em>self-contained</em> and <em>minimum</em> example of the error is crucial. This might involve a little bit of work on your side, to extract the essential bits of code from their context and to ensure that it can run, at least, up to the point where it does not due to the error. The “steps to reproduce” section of a bug report is so important and useful that anyone who makes sure to include a good one into their bug report would be perfectly justified in expecting that strawberry cheesecake and a orange mocha frappuccino get delivered to their doorstep the moment the report is posted.</p></li>

<h2>Help, Discussion, and Comments<a class="headerlink" href="#help-discussion-and-comments" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/dendropy-users">DendroPy Users</a> discussion group is available for general discussion on the usage of the DendroPy library.
If you want more information on how to use a particular feature or carry out specific task or want to make some general comments on the DendroPy library, you should post a message to the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/dendropy-users">DendroPy Users</a> discussion group.
I follow and respond to messages on this group fairly regularly, so you should get a response within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Of course, we accept all bug reports, bad or good, and I guess we would prefer to have a bad bug report than no report at all, so if all the above seem enough of a hassle to discourage you from posting an issue at all, feel free to go ahead and write it up any way you see fit.</p>
