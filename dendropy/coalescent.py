    Returns a list of nodes that have not yet coalesced once `period` is

    `nodes` is a list of DendroPy Nodes representing a sample of
    neutral genes (some, all, or none of these nodes may have
    descendent nodes).

    `pop_size` is the effective *haploid* population size; i.e., number of gene
    in the population: 2 * N in a diploid population of N individuals,
    or N in a haploid population of N individuals.

    or 0 or None, then time is in haploid population units; i.e. where 1 unit
    of time equals 2N generations for a diploid population of size N, or N
    generations for a haploid population of size N. Otherwise time is in
    generations.

    This function will a draw a coalescence time, `t`, from
    an exponential distribution with a rate of `choose(k, 2)`, where `k` is the
    number of nodes. If `period` is given and if this time is less
    than `period`, or if `period` is not given, then two nodes are
    selected at random from `nodes`, and coalesced: a new node is
    created, and the two nodes are added as child_nodes to this node with
    an edge length such the the total length from tip to the ancestral
    node is equal to the depth of the deepest child + `t`. The two
    nodes are removed from the list of nodes, and the new node is
    added to it. `t` is then deducted from `period`, and the process
    repeats.

    The function ends and returns the list of nodes once `period` is
    exhausted or if any draw of `t` exceeds `period`, if `period` is
    given or when there is only one node left.

    As each coalescent event occurs, *all* nodes have their edges
    extended to the point of the coalescent event. In the case of
    constrained coalescence, all uncoalesced nodes have their edges
    extended to the end of the period (coalesced nodes have the edges
    fixed by the coalescent event in their ancestor).  Thus multiple
    calls to this method with the same set of nodes will gradually
    'grow' the edges, until all the the nodes coalesce. The edge
    lengths of the nodes passed to this method thus should not be
    modified or reset until the process is complete.
