    A random draw from the "Kingman distribution" (discrete time version): Time
    to go from ``n_genes`` genes to ``n_genes``-1 genes in a continuous-time
    Wright-Fisher population of ``pop_size`` genes; i.e. waiting time until
    ``n-genes`` lineages coalesce in a population of ``pop_size`` genes.

    Given the number of gene lineages in a sample, ``n_genes``, and a
    population size, ``pop_size``, this function returns a random number from
    an exponential distribution with rate $\choose(``pop_size``, 2)$.
    ``pop_size`` is the effective *haploid* population size; i.e., number of gene
    in the population: 2 * N in a diploid population of N individuals,
    or N in a haploid population of N individuals. If ``pop_size`` is 1 or 0 or
    None, then time is in haploid population units; i.e. where 1 unit of time
    equals 2N generations for a diploid population of size N, or N generations
    for a haploid population of size N. Otherwise time is in generations.

    The coalescence time, or the waiting time for the coalescence, of two
    gene lineages evolving in a population with haploid size $N$ is an
    exponentially-distributed random variable with rate of $N$ an
    expectation of $\frac{1}{N}$).
    The waiting time for coalescence of *any* two gene lineages in a sample of
    $n$ gene lineages evolving in a population with haploid size $N$ is an
    exponentially-distributed random variable with rate of $\choose{N, 2}$ and
    an expectation of $\frac{1}{\choose{N, 2}}$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_genes : integer

def coalesce_nodes(

):
    """
    Returns a list of nodes that have not yet coalesced once ``period`` is
    exhausted.

    This function will a draw a coalescence time, ``t``, from an exponential
    distribution with a rate of ``choose(k, 2)``, where ``k`` is the number of
    nodes. If ``period`` is given and if this time is less than ``period``, or if
    ``period`` is not given, then two nodes are selected at random from ``nodes``,
    and coalesced: a new node is created, and the two nodes are added as
    child_nodes to this node with an edge length such the the total length from
    tip to the ancestral node is equal to the depth of the deepest child + ``t``.
    The two nodes are removed from the list of nodes, and the new node is added
    to it. ``t`` is then deducted from ``period``, and the process repeats.

    The function ends and returns the list of nodes once ``period`` is
    exhausted or if any draw of ``t`` exceeds ``period``, if ``period`` is
    given or when there is only one node left.

    As each coalescent event occurs, *all* nodes have their edges
    extended to the point of the coalescent event. In the case of
    constrained coalescence, all uncoalesced nodes have their edges
    extended to the end of the period (coalesced nodes have the edges
    fixed by the coalescent event in their ancestor).  Thus multiple
    calls to this method with the same set of nodes will gradually
    'grow' the edges, until all the the nodes coalesce. The edge
    lengths of the nodes passed to this method thus should not be
    modified or reset until the process is complete.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodes : iterable[|Node|]
        An interable of |Node| objects representing a sample of neutral
        genes (some, all, or none of these nodes may have descendent nodes).
    pop_size : integer
        The effective *haploid* population size; i.e., number of genes in the
        population: 2 * N in a diploid population of N individuals, or N in a
        haploid population of N individuals.
    period : numeric
        The time that the genes have to coalesce. If ``pop_size`` is 1 or 0 or
        None, then time is in haploid population units; i.e. where 1 unit of
        time equals 2N generations for a diploid population of size N, or N
        generations for a haploid population of size N. Otherwise time is in
        generations.
    rng : ``Random`` object
        The random number generator instance to use. If not specified, the
        default RNG will be used.
    use_expected_tmrca : bool
        If |True|, then instead of random times, the *expected* times will be
        used.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : iterable[|Node|]
        A list of nodes once ``period`` is exhausted or if any draw of ``t``

    Returns a gene tree simulated under the coalescent contained within a

            The population or species tree. If ``edge_pop_size_map`` is not None,
            and population sizes given are non-trivial (i.e., >1), then edge
            lengths on this tree are in units of generations. Otherwise edge

            size N.

        ``gene_to_containing_taxon_map``
            A TaxonNamespaceMapping object mapping Taxon objects in the
            ``containing_tree`` TaxonNamespace to corresponding Taxon objects in the
            resulting gene tree.

        ``edge_pop_size_attr``
            Name of attribute of edges that specify population size. By default
            this is "pop_size". If this attribute does not exist,
            ``default_pop_size`` will be used.  The value for this attribute

            i.e.  2N for a diploid population of N individuals, or N for a
            haploid population of N individuals. This value determines how
            branch length units are interpreted in the input tree,
            ``containing_tree``.  If a biologically-meaningful value, then branch
            lengths on the ``containing_tree`` are properly read as generations.
            If not (e.g. 1 or 0), then they are in population units, i.e. where
            1 unit of time equals 2N generations for a diploid population of
            size N, or N generations for a haploid population of size N.
            Otherwise time is in generations. If this argument is None, then
            population sizes default to ``default_pop_size``.

        ``default_pop_size``
            Population size to use if ``edge_pop_size_attr`` is None or
            if an edge does not have the attribute. Defaults to 1.

    The returned gene tree will have the following extra attributes:

            A dictionary with nodes of ``containing_tree`` as keys and a list of gene
            tree nodes that are uncoalesced as values.

    Given a population tree, ``pop_tree`` this will return a *pair of
    trees*: a gene tree simulated on this population tree based on
    Kingman's n-coalescent, and population tree with the additional
    attribute 'gene_nodes' on each node, which is a list of
    uncoalesced nodes from the gene tree associated with the given
    node from the population tree.

    ``pop_tree``: a Tree object.

    ``gene_sampling_strategy``: string
        - "node_attribute": Will expect each leaf of ``pop_tree`` to
          have an attribute, ``num_genes``, that specifies the number
          of genes to be sampled from that population.
        - "fixed_per_population": Will assign ``num_genes`` to each population.
        - "random_uniform": Will assign genes to leaves with
          uniform probability until ``num_genes`` genes have been
          assigned.

    ``pop_size_attr``: string
        The attribute name of the edges of ``pop_tree`` that
        specify the population size. By default it is ``pop_size``. The should
        specify the effective *haploid* population size; i.e., number of gene
        in the population: 2 * N in a diploid population of N individuals,
        or N in a haploid population of N individuals.

    If ``pop_size`` is 1 or 0 or None, then the edge lengths of ``pop_tree`` is
    taken to be in haploid population units; i.e. where 1 unit equals 2N
    generations for a diploid population of size N, or N generations for a
    haploid population of size N. Otherwise the edge lengths of ``pop_tree`` is
    taken to be in generations.

    If ``gene_tree_list`` is given, then the gene tree is added to the
    tree block, and the tree block's taxa block will be used to manage
    the gene tree's ``taxa``.

    ``gene_node_label_fn`` is a function that takes two arguments (a string
    and an integer, respectively, where the string is the containing species
    taxon label and the integer is the gene index) and returns a label for
    the corresponding the gene node.

    if ``decorate_original_tree`` is True, then the list of uncoalesced nodes at
    each node of the population tree is added to the original (input) population
    tree instead of a copy.

    If ``num_genes`` is None, then it will be set to 1 under the
    "node_attribute" strategy (serving as a fallback default for nodes that do
    not spcify ``num_genes_attr``) or the leaf count of ``pop_tree`` under the
    ``random_uniform`` strategy.

    Note that this function does very much the same thing as
    ``contained_coalescent_tree()``,
    but provides a very different API.
