class Bipartition(object):
    """
    A bipartition on a tree.

    A bipartition of a tree is a division or sorting of the leaves/tips of a
    tree into two mutually-exclusive and collectively-comprehensive subsets,
    obtained by bisecting the tree at a particular edge. There is thus a
    one-to-one correspondence with an edge of a tree and a bipartition. The
    term "split" is often also used to refer to the same concept, though this
    is typically applied to unrooted trees.

    A bipartition is modeled using a bitmask. This is a a bit array
    representing the membership of taxa, with the least-significant bit
    corresponding to the first taxon, the next least-signficant bit
    corresponding to the second taxon, and so on, till the last taxon
    corresponding to the most-significant bit. Taxon membership in one of two
    arbitrary groups, '0' or '1', is indicated by its corresponding bit being
    unset or set, respectively.

    To allow comparisons and correct identification of the same bipartition
    across different rotational and orientiational representations of unrooted
    trees, we *normalize* the bipartition such that the first taxon is always
    assigned to group '0' for bipartition representations of unrooted trees.

    The normalization of the bitmask loses information about the actual
    descendents of a particular edge. Thus in addition to the
    :attr:`Bipartition.bitmask` attribute, each |Bipartition| object
    also maintains a :attr:`Bipartition.leafset_bitmask` attribute which is
    *unnormalized*. This is a bit array representing the presence or absence of
    taxa in the subtree descending from the child node of the edge of which
    this bipartition is associated. The least-significant bit corresponds to
    the first taxon, the next least-signficant bit corresponds to the second
    taxon, and so on, with the last taxon corresponding to the most-significant
    bit. For rooted trees, the value of :attr:`Bipartition.bitmask` and
    :attr:`Bipartition.leafset_bitmask` are identical. For unrooted trees, they
    may or may not be equal.

    In general, we use :attr:`Bipartition.bitmask` data to establish the *identity*
    of a split or bipartition across *different* trees: for example, when
    computing the Robinson-Foulds distances between trees, or in assessing the
    support for different bipartitions given an MCMC or bootstrap sample of trees.
    Here the normalization of the bitmask in unrooted trees allows for the
    (arbitrarily-labeled) group '0' to be consistent across different
    representations, rotations, and orientations of trees.

    On the other hand, we use :attr:`Bipartition.leafset_bitmask` data to work
    with various ancestor-descendent relationships *within* the *same* tree:
    for example, to quickly assess if a taxon descends from a particular
    node in a given tree, or if a particular node is a common ancestor of
    two taxa in a given tree.

    The |Bipartition| object might be used in keys in dictionaries and
    look-up tables implemented as sets to allow for, e.g., calculation of
    support in terms of the number times a particular bipartition is observed.
    The :attr:`Bipartition.bitmask` is used as hash value for this purpose. As
    such, it is crucial that this value does not change once a particular
    |Bipartition| object is stored in a dictionary or set. To this end,
    we impose the constraint that |Bipartition| objects are immutable
    unless the ``is_mutable`` attribute is explicitly set to |True| as a sort
    of waiver signed by the client code. Client code does this at its risk,
    with the warning that anything up to and including the implosion of the
    universe may occur if the |Bipartition| object is a member of an set
    of dictionary at the time (or, at the very least, the modified
    |Bipartition| object may not be accessible from dictionaries
    and sets in which it is stored, or may occlude other
    |Bipartition| objects in the container).

    Note
    ----

    There are two possible ways of mapping taxa to bits in a bitarray or bitstring.

    In the "Least-Signficiant-Bit" (LSB) scheme, the first taxon corresponds to the
    least-significant, or left-most bit. So, given four taxa, indexed from 1 to 4,
    taxon 1 would map to 0b0001, taxon 2 would map to 0b0010, taxon 3 would map
    to 0b0100, and taxon 4 would map to 0b1000.

    In the "Most-Significant-Bit" (MSB) scheme, on the other hand, the first taxon
    corresponds to the most-significant, or right-most bit. So, given four
    taxa, indexed from 1 to 4, taxon 1 would map to 0b1000, taxon 2 would map
    to 0b0100, taxon 3 would map to 0b0010, and taxon 4 would map to 0b0001.

    We selected the Least Significant Bit (LSB) approach because the MSB scheme
    requires the size of the taxon namespace to fixed before the index can be
    assigned to any taxa. For example, under the MSB scheme, if there are 4
    taxa, the bitmask for taxon 1 is 0b1000 == 8, but if another taxon is
    added, then the bitmask for taxon 1 will become 0b10000 == 16. On the other
    hand, under the LSB scheme, the bitmask for taxon 1 will be 0b0001 == 1 if
    there are 4 taxa, and 0b00001 == 1 if there 5 taxa, and so on. This
    stability of taxon indexes even as the taxon namespace grows is a strongly
    desirable property, and thus the adoption of the LSB scheme.

    Constraining the first taxon to be in group 0 (LSB-0) rather than group 1
    (LSB-1) is motivated by the fact that, in the former, we would combine
    the bitmasks of child nodes using OR (logical addition) operations when
    calculating the bitmask for a parent node, whereas, with the latter, we
    would need to use AND operations. The former strikes us as more intuitive.
